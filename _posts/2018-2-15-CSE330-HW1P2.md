Semaphore
---
* Textbook(10th) Chap 6.1 - 6.6 
* (Update) **NOTE on the Dijkstra's semaphore vs blocking semaphore ** Busy waiting is that you put the waiting process in a while loop, which keeps checking itself whether itâ€™s good or not to let go. Meanwhile blocking utilizes a timer that puts the blocked process on hold for a set amount of time. Busy waiting consumes a lot of CPU power while blocking does not.
* (Update)[Busy waiting vs blocking](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26541119/whats-different-between-the-blocked-and-busy-waiting)
* [Slides by Prof. Gagan Agrawal from OSU](http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~agrawal.28/760/Slides/jan12.pdf)
* [Slides by Prof. Ed Lazowska from U Washington](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse451/10au/lectures/8-sema_mon.pdf)

Bi-directional Circular Queue
---
* **DO NOT USE DUMMY ELEMENTS!** There's no point using them.
* What rotateQ is supposed to do is shown below. Notice you don't need to implement a tail pointer, but it's easier to understand with a tail.
![rotateq](../images/rotateq.png "rotateq")
* (Update) Q-element can technically be of any type. You may want to look into 'auto' type supported since C++11. 
* (Update) A good test file should at least call every single function once in order to demonstrate your entire functionality.
