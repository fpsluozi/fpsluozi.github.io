In this post, I will go over some limitations of the k-means algorithm. To better understand the algorithm, I highly recommend you look into [Stanford's CS229 course note on clustering](http://cs229.stanford.edu/notes/cs229-notes7a.pdf).

## K-means in two steps

So basically speaking, k-means is one of the many unsupervised clustering algorithms to help each one of the data points find their group. The number of clusters, k, is fixed as a given.

* Initialization: Randomly choose k points as initial centroids. ($$\mu_1, \mu_2, ... \mu_k$$)
* Step 1: Assign each point $$x_i$$ to its closest centroid in Eucleadian distance. **(The $$\mu$$s are fixed)**
* Step 2: Update the centroids by taking the mean of each cluster. **(The cluster boundaries are fixed)**
* REPEAT Step 1 and Step 2 until convergence (when points don't switch their clusters in Step 1).

What k-means utilizes here is called [Coordinate Descent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_descent). The error is bound to converge. But since the SSE (Sum of Squared Error) we aim to minimize is non-convex, we will reach some local minima instead of the global minimum.

$$
SSE = \sum^{k}_{i=1} \sum_{x \in C_i} distance^2(\mu_i, x)
$$

## Limitations of K-means

K-mens is not perfect. It is incapable when it comes to the following situations. Most the following graphs are from [the offical textbook notes of Introduction to Data Mining by Tan, Steinbach, and Kumar](https://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~kumar001/dmbook/slides/chap7_basic_cluster_analysis.pdf).

### Non-globular Cluster Shape

A universal approach to overcome such limitations to start with a large k, then combine the smaller clusters. In this sense, choosing an appropriate k and initial centroids plays big parts which may eventually affect the local minimum we converge into.
